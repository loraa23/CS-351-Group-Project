week 8 (10/12 - 10/18):

- We decided on using a red-black tree for our main advanced data structure. It will hold all of the event objects for the schedule. We chose this because will will be doing frequent searches and insertions, and the data needed to be in order. Our second choice was skip lists, but decided against it because we don't have a large dataset, so a red-black tree is more appropriate

- Hibatul will create the figma wireframe for this project
