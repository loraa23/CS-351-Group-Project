week 7 (10/5 - 10/11) meeting notes:

- We changed our project idea slightly to make the overall project less generic:

The idea is to provide a single, cohesive schedule that includes both class and cta/metra schedules on one page. It would work similar to the website when2meet.com (where for each day of the week, you drag and select the times you're busy). The app would then automatically fill the schedule with the minimum train commute based on which train stations are closest to your home and uic (the user will select their preferred station), and the information pulled from metra/cta api's.

We could also include a map of UIC that highlights buildings where each class is located alongside the schedule. There will also be a schedule builder feature. 

The benefit is that you have a full printable schedule in one place rather than having to constantly reference two different schedules.
